        <h1>How to Play</h1>
        <p></p>
        
        <p>Select an aircraft for each square that meets the criteria for both the row and column value. Categories are independent, so that aircraft doesn't need to record both categories together.</p>
        <p>For example, if the categories are Manufactured by Airbus and Operated by Emirates, the aircraft must be both currently in Emirates fleet and manufactured by Airbus.</p>
        <p>There are no limits on the number of guesses per square. <!-- Need a hint? Switch to hint mode to be shown six airplanes, one is the most common guessed by other players. --> </p>
        <p>You can change a submitted Aircraft by clicking the square again, even after the game is complete.</p>

        <h2>Rarities</h2>

        <p>An aircraft's rarity indicates what percentage that aircraft makes up out of the category:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Common (>15%)</li>
            <li>Bronze (10 - 15%)</li>
            <li>Silver (5 - 10%)</li>
            <li>Gold (1 - 5%)</li>
            <li>Galaxy (0.1 - 1%)</li>
            <li>ðŸ¦„ Unicorn (&lt;0.1%)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <!--
            <p>*Multiple aircraft can be unicorns for the same square at the same time. E.g. If there are 100 valid answers for a square, and the rarest aircraft has been guessed by 5 users, then all other aircraft guessed 5 times will also be unicorns.</p>
        -->
<!--
<h2>Reverse Mode ðŸ”¥</h2>

In Reverse Mode, your goal is to guess the most common player for each square instead of the rarest. Guesses are ranked from 1st to 6th most common. Any guesses outside that range are marked with ðŸ¥¶.

Rarity colors are reversed â€” but the most common player has a unique ðŸ”¥ design instead of the unicorn.


Fire unicorn (1st, most common player)

Galaxy (2nd)

Blue (3rd)

Gold (4th)

Silver (5th)

Bronze (6th)

ðŸ¥¶
Outside top 6

You can toggle Reverse Mode on or off anytime during a game.

Example category combinations

Remember, cateogories are completely independent from one another!

Team & Team


A player must have recorded at least 1 regular or playoff game with each team. It does not have to be the same season.

Teammate & Team



A player must have recorded at least 1 regular or playoff game with the team, and 1 regular or playoff game with the teammate. It does not have to be the same season, nor does the game with the teammate need to be with the team.

Teammate & Stat/Accolade


40+ Points
(Game)
For a player to qualify for a 'Teammate/Coach & Stat/Accolade' square, that player must have recorded at least 1 regular or playoff game with the teammate/coach and qualify for the stat/accolade.

It does not have to be the same season regardless if the Stat/Accolade is Career or Season.

Stat/Accolade & Team


100+ Assists
(Season)
A player must have recorded at least 1 regular or playoff game with the team and qualify for the stat/accolade. The stat/accolate does not need to be achieved with that team.
